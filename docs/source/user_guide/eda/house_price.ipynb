    "### Task Description\n",
    "House Prices is a classical Kaggle competition. The task is to predicts final price of each house. For more detail, refer to https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this notebook\n",
    "As it is a famous competition, there exists lots of excelent analysis on how to do eda and how to build model for this task. See https://www.kaggle.com/khandelwallaksya/house-prices-eda for a reference. In this notebook, we will show how dataprep.eda can simply the eda process using a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion:\n",
    "* **Understand the problem**. We'll look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.\n",
    "* **Univariable study**. We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to know a little bit more about it.\n",
    "* **Multivariate study**. We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.\n",
    "* **Basic cleaning**. We'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables."

    "* **Missing value**-How many missing values each column contains. For instance, Fence contains 80.8% * 1460 = 1180 missing tuples. Usually, some model does not allow the input data contains missing value such as SVM, we have to clean the data before we utilize it.\n",
    "* **Target Value**-The distribution of target value (SalePrice). According to the distribution of the target value, we could get the information that the target value is numerical and the distribution of the target value conforms to the norm distribution. Thus, we are not confronted with imbalanced classes problem. It is really great.\n",

Both cases show how significant the correlation is between these variables. Actually, this correlation is so strong that it can indicate a situation of multicollinearity. If we think about these variables, we can conclude that they give almost the same information so multicollinearity really occurs. Heatmaps are great to detect this kind of situations and in problems dominated by feature selection, like ours, they are an essential tool.\n",
