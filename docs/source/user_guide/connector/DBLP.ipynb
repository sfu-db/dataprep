    "## What is DataPrep.Connector?\n",
    "\n",
    "Connector is an intuitive, open-source API wrapper that speeds up development by standardizing calls to multiple APIs as a simple workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connector provides a simple wrapper to collect structured data from different Web APIs (e.g., Twitter, Spotify), making web data collection easy and efficient, without requiring advanced programming skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Connector, you can collect data in two steps: **connect** to a website and **query** the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently support tens of websites: https://github.com/sfu-db/DataConnectorConfigs/tree/develop/api-connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also author your own configuration files for new websites.\n",
    "We look forward to seeing your contribution to facilitate other users as well."
